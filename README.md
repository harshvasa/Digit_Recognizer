# Digit_Recognizer
 Built an artificial neural network for digit recognition from scratch applying the feedforward and backpropagation algorithms using numpy. â€¢ Used sigmoid function for hidden layer followed by softmax function with cross entropy function for output layer to get an accuracy of 87.4%.
